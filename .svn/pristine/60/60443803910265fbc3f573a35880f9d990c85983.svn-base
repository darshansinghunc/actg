; make sure that one string is not substring of the other
; all BAM datafiles should be rooted from <root_dir>/dataout/
; these directories should be writable
; All data alias strings should be in all CAPS e.g. V3T1S1
; The data alias string should be same as bam directory name - enforcing it as a good housekeeping practice
; This can have data for all the projects
